## Development conventions

- **Markdown is owned by markdownlint, never prettier.** `*.md` is in `.prettierignore` (one owner per
  file type — see the reasoning there), so `prettier --check some.md` reports success because the file
  was **skipped**, not because it is clean. That false pass is the trap; do not use it as a gate.

  After writing or editing any `.md`, fix it mechanically before reporting done:

  ```bash
  pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2 --fix path/to/file.md && pnpm lint:md
  ```

  `--fix` repairs nearly everything on its own — emphasis/bullet-marker consistency (MD049/MD004,
  resolved *per file* from the first marker used, so a file may not mix `_` and `*`), blank lines around
  headings, lists and fences, trailing whitespace, blank-line runs, and the final newline. Only two
  rules it cannot fix, so write these correctly the first time:
  - **MD040** — every fenced code block needs a language (` ```bash `, ` ```sql `, ` ```text ` for
    plain output).
  - **MD036** — a bold-only line is not a heading; use a real `###` heading, or fold the bold text into
    a sentence.

  Two house conventions the linter does not enforce: wrap prose at **100 columns** (MD013 is off only
  because SpecKit task lines and wide tables must not wrap — prose still wraps), and write **compact**
  table pipes `|---|---|` (MD060 is off for this reason).

- **Route index**: `src/app/dev/routes/page.tsx` lists every UI page and API endpoint. As of feature
  016 it is **generated from the source tree** (`src/server/lib/routeInventory.ts`, shared with
  `auth.routeInventory.test.ts`) and shown only to a Super-user. There is **nothing to hand-maintain** —
  a new route appears automatically. *(The previous convention to keep two arrays in sync was retired
  here.)*
