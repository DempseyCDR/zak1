/**
 * Volunteer navigation — the server loader (feature 016; restructured for 035, P6-R2).
 *
 * Rendered from the ROOT layout so it appears on every page beneath the public menu, but only when a
 * volunteer is signed in: it loads the actor's grants (nullable — returns null for anonymous visitors,
 * FR-005), offers only the destinations their capabilities permit, and hands them to the client
 * presenter for rendering + active-state. Grants are loaded live per request (FR-014), no caching.
 *
 * ⚠️ Presentation, not a control — the routes enforce authorization regardless. Omitting a link never
 * grants or denies anything; it just declines to invite someone somewhere they would be refused.
