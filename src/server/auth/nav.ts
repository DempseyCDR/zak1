 * Role-aware navigation (feature 016, US5; FR-039).
 *
 * ⚠️ Navigation is a COURTESY, not a control. Hiding a link is presentation — the routes enforce
 * authorization regardless, so a destination absent from someone's nav is still refused if they request
 * it directly (US5 scenario 3). Do not let anything here be mistaken for a security boundary.
 *
 * Each item is shown when the actor holds the capability that page is FOR — the primary job of the
 * page, not merely read access. A base volunteer can *read* the gate figures (money is open, FR-015),
 * but the gate page is for entering money, so it appears only for `gate.write` holders. That keeps nav
 * about "what is your job" rather than "what could you look at".
