 *
 * The rule is therefore "every merge whose survivor is this contact, or is a contact that has since
 * become this contact". Newest first, which is also the order they must be undone in (FR-008).
 *
 * A contact's OWN retirement still does not appear on its record — the undo control belongs with the
