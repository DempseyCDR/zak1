// Feature 052 (P7-R8): the single privacy gate for public venue exposure. A venue's address, map link, and
// directions are shown publicly ONLY when it is public AND has an address; otherwise the public projection is
// NAME-ONLY. The nullable fields carry the gate into the type — a renderer can only show what the projection
// provides, so a private-home address can never reach a public surface. Both public surfaces (the /directions
// page via `listPublicVenues`, and the event page via `getPublicEventDetail`) go through here.
